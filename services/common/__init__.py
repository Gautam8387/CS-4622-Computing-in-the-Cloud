# ./services/common/__init__.py
# This file makes 'common' a Python package.
# It can be empty or used to expose specific functions/classes.

# Example: expose storage functions directly if desired
# from .storage import upload_file, download_file, create_presigned_url, upload_fileobj

# For now, keep it simple, users will import from common.storage
